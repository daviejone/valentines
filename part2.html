        <p>
          The first time na nakilala kita, I really thought na masungit ka,
          snobber ka and all..pero, hindi pala snobber.. masungit lang HAHAHA
          just kidding. When i first chatted you and spent my time with you, I
          really enjoyed your company. I had fun, and felt like you were really
          the one that made me happy, and it came true. You gave me everything
          that I ever wanted and needed from someone, and I dont know how
          special and lucky I am to have you in my life. Happy Valentines Day my
          Bb!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankyou for the last two year of us being together as a couple and 3
          years for being together with me. You really really made my years fill
          with joy, sadness, love, all these different emotions that I crave na
          makuha sayo, nabigyan mo. Thankyou for always being there for me when
          I feel alone or sad. Thankyou for understanding my problems,
          insecurities, and understanding me in everything i do and i am.
          Thankyou for loving me with all your heart and for showing and giving
          your love to me. It really makes me feel like im the luckiest guy in
          this world HAHAHA how this kind of person suddenly came into my life
          through online platform then changed my life forever. I love you so
          much!
        </p>
        <p>
          Please know that I will always always be here for you wherever you are
          my bb. If you feel sad, alone, in need of someone, always read this
          letter that I gave to you, the short messages that i made for you, and
          HARPY to be with you, and itll let you know that Ill always be there
          for you. I know our decision must be done and it is better for the
          both of us especially for you, and sobrang sakit gawin hahahah knowing
          that someone as special as you will leave me(not physically), but I
          know that as long as makita lang kita na masaya, at peace, and having
          a bright future, i will really really be happy with it. So always
          always grow okay? grow, heal, be stronger, more independent, braver,
          and still have the same personality, kasi you are really worth it. You
          are everything that any guy can ever ask for and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being my love, being part of my life, and being my girl.
          You bring so much happiness and pilosopohan into my world. Please know
          that I love you deeply and unconditionally.
